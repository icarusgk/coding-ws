# Advanced features of the library 
# * setUp and tearDown methods

# Sometimes we need to created class instances, temporary files or access the web in tests
# These resources are called fixtures.
# These methods provide an easy mechanism to configure and clean up any fixtures

# The code inside the setUp() method is executed before every test method
# The code inside the tearDown() method is executed after every test mthod

# These methods save us from having to write the same code for each test
